GigaAnalysis
========================================

GigaAnalysis is a package that is used for processing sweep data from
experimental physics. It was developed for the use in high magnetic field
facilities, where each measurement one dependant variable is changed
(magnetic field), often rapidly and the complete data set is formed by
assembling many of these measurements.
