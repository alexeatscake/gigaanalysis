# gigaanalysis

version 0.01

This project is built from the beginning of the quantum oscillations project started on the Tallahassee trip in April 2019. This version is designed to reproduce what Mega Analysis does, and add more error handling to help other members of the group use the program. Since then it has been growing into a tool box with many useful things needed for high field magnetic studies.

At the moment it only has two sections
* data - This contains the Data class and relevant functions to manipulate it.
* qo - This are a series of tools and children of the data class tailored for analysing quantum osculations.
